My name is Nathan Thimothe, and I am a junior at Williams College pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science! I am an aspiring software engineer with experience in languages including Python, Java, C, Swift, Go, and Arduino and tools including Git and Unix. I'm currently working as a Teaching Assistant at Williams and working to become a better engineer by practicing algorithmic thinking, working on new personal projects, and ameliorating projects I have already written. After I graduate, I hope to work at a company that creates software that impacts people's lives for the better. 

Outside of classes, I am a member of Underrepresented Identities in Computer Science (UnICS) which is an initiative that seeks to raise awareness of the problems that currently face underrepresented identities in the major and encourage discussion and action to solve them. I also have a small business on campus selling lemonade to students and staff. I started the business in the beginning of my sophomore year in an effort to bring a sustainable, new, and exciting approach to lemonade. Outside of school, I really enjoy practicing French, reading, and listening to podcasts.
