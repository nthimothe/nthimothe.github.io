My name is Nathan Thimothe, and I am currently a Android Software Development Engineer at Amazon working on mobile authentication! I have experience in Java, Python, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, C, Swift, Go, and Arduino and tools including Git and Android Studio. 

Outside of work, I really enjoy learning new languages, reading, and listening to podcasts.
