My name is Nathan Thimothe, and I am a senior at Williams College pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science! I am an aspiring software engineer with experience in languages including Python, Java, C, Swift, Go, and Arduino and tools including Git and Android Studio. I recently finished a summer as a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon where I worked on Android security in Java. I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant at Williams and striving to become a better engineer by working on new personal projects and improving previous ones. After I graduate, I will be working as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. 

Outside of classes, I have a small business selling lemonade to students and staff at my college. I started the business in the beginning of my sophomore year in an effort to bring a sustainable, new, and exciting approach to lemonade. Outside of school, I really enjoy studying French, reading, and listening to podcasts.
